## [Smooth Transaction](https://smooth-transaction.herokuapp.com/)

[{% img ../images/projects/smooth-transaction.png %}](https://smooth-transaction.herokuapp.com/)

For my final project at [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com) I worked on a four person team to create _Smooth Transaction_. Our goal was to create an easy way for non-profit organizations to accept donations on their website. Simply sign-up with us and connect your Stripe account, and a snippit of code is automatically generated that you can easily copy and paste into an HTML document to have a donation widget. Smooth Transaction also features a dashboard to show history and trends of donations.

I personally contributed to all aspects of the web app, but I primarily worked with back-end tasks including the database, server, user authentication, and deployment to heroku. I also handled writing the AJAX calls for the dashboard.

Notable technologies: [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/), [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)

About halfway through the curriculum at [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com), I wanted to try creating a chatroom. But not just any chatroom, I wanted to have GIFs sent with every message! This was my first time dealing with both Node and web sockets and I had a blast creating it. There's a ton I'd like to do with this project and I plan to implement many more features soon. As of now, it works by users entering their message, followed by a search for the GIF they'd like to attach to that message. Give it a try with some friends, it's a lot of fun!

Notable technologies: [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/), [socket.io](http://socket.io/), [Giphy API](https://api.giphy.com/)
