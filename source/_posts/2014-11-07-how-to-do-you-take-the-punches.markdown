<p>According to Dr. L. Nathanson, if people do not process shame in a healthy way, they will generally respond to it in one of four defensive directions which he has organized in the <a href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf">"Compass of Shame"</a>. As shown in the picture below, these four directions are <span class="italic">withdrawal</span>, <span class="italic">attack self</span>, <span class="italic">avoidance</span>, and <span class="italic">attack other</span>. This week, <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">DBC</a> has asked us to examine our lives and ask ourselves how we respond to conflict and shame.</p>

<p>I think that most people have used all four of these defense mechanisms at some point but generally we go to one more often. In the past, I've definitely reacted to shame in the direction of attacking myself. There's lots of examples I could give, but to be honest, it's a little too personal for me to just spill out for anyone on the Internet to see. Today, I can say that I've gotten a lot better at not doing this and instead learning from any emotional conflict I encounter, but this skill was something that I had to work at. And in a weird way, I think my tenancy to "attack myself" actually helped me to improve my ability to process shame. Why do I think this? Well, the way I would attack myself was by blaming myself for the conflict and putting myself down. This is definitely not healthy but it led to a lot of self examination. Of course, examining yourself with the wrong attitude can be very damaging, but luckily I managed to eventually turn it positive.</p>

<p>I used to wonder all the time, what could I have done differently that would have prevented the conflict. Sometimes this would make me blame myself wrongfully, which led to putting myself down. I'd hold onto the shame, and that sucked. But looking inside myself sparked other discoveries that I think helped me to let go of the shame and look at the experience as a chance to learn and improve myself. Instead of putting myself down, I began to grow stronger.</p>

<p>I'm not perfect, but I think I've become pretty good at spotting when my mind wants to go down it's old path of attacking myself. Being aware of my emotional reactions gives me the ability to see it with a clearer mind and process my emotions more healthily.</p>

<p>So what does this have to do with learning to code? In any field you are going to be working with other people. And when people get together, there tends to be conflict at some point. So I think DBC is trying to help us improve ourselves more than just technically so that we are just better human beings. And as better human beings, we can be better developers!</p>
