<p>Any musician will tell you that feedback is the worst! Have you ever been to a concert and heard a loud, shrieking, buzzing sound build up out of no where?! Yeah, it's pretty horrible. But all of us at <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">DBC</a> love feedback! That is, giving and receiving feedback on our interpersonal and programming skills. We are learning so much, so fast, so it's important to have some kind of indication on how we are doing.</p>

<p>So far, the main way us students are getting feedback is through pairing. For the most part, I have really enjoyed paired programming. I am always surprised by how efficiently we are able to work though a problem that would have probably taken me much longer to do alone. There's always opportunity to learn and to teach. And on top of all that, we get the chance to work with many different kinds of people which is a great way to practice communication skills. When you are navigating while pairing with someone, you don't have your hands on the code. Because of this, you really need to communicate clearly to get your ideas across to the other person. For something as technical as programming, this ability is very important. I've found that keeping communication flowing as much as possible leads to the best pairing sessions.</p>

<p>After we pair, we then give the other student feedback, anonymously. When I read my feedback for the first time, I was a little nervous. I wasn't sure how I would react if someone had something super critical to say. Of course, nothing like this happened and most people had lots of very positive things to say. I did notice a slight jump of my stomach when someone pointed out areas that I needed to improve, but I quickly reminded myself that this will help me grow. My feedback has taught me to be more assertive with my ideas when I know a better solution than my pair.</p>

<p>When I first gave feedback to another student, I remember feeling a little conflicted about it. I really didn't want to come off the wrong way, but I also didn't want leave something out for the sake of someone's feelings. I found that it is important to point out strengths and weaknesses of your pair so that they know what they are doing right, and what what they need to improve on. I've also found that being honest is the best thing to do while giving feedback.</p>
