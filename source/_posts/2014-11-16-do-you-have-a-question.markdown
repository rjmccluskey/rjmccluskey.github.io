<p>Tomorrow is the big day. I start Phase 1 of <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">DBC</a> which means that the learning switches from remote to in-person and the real work begins. I'm so excited, a little nervous, really happy, but also kinda sad that I'll be away from some of the people I love for a little while. Anyways, DBC is awesome because our education here is by no means traditional. In fact, a lot of it is up to us students asking for the right things. If we need help on something we need to ask for it because we're gonna be moving fast! It's really important that to get good answers, you need to ask good questions. So let's talk about how to ask good technical questions.</p>

<p>So what makes a good question? Wait... was that good question? Just messing ;) I think the very first thing you need in order to ask a good question is to do as much research on your own within a reasonable time frame. If you're chasing down random links on Google and not finding anything helpful then you're pretty safe to start asking questions. This first step is important because it helps you to fully understand exactly what it is that you're having trouble with.</p>

<p>Now that you know exactly what the problem is, you need to present it in a short and specific way. When posting a question online, this would involve the title of your post. Obviously since it is a title, it will be short but that doesn't mean you should be too general. Imagine that you are trying to ask your question to your really busy boss. Be short and straight to the point with the title. If you're asking a question in person, you don't exactly have a title (unless you write it on a sticky note and put it on your head). So you can skip this part.</p>

<p>Next, you'll want to explain the background of your problem. Introduce your problem by explaining how you got to it. What were you trying to do what what tools where you using? Explain the scope of the problem so that whoever is helping you knows exactly what was going on. After that you'll want to post some actual lines of code so that the person helping you can recreate the problem is need be. Remember that any error messages may also be helpful.</p>

<p>Sometimes when we are asking programming questions we want to jump straight to the error because that's what we are focused on. But it is important to present the full scope of the problem because the person we are asking the question to, or any readers online, doesn't know exactly what you were doing before you got there.</p>
