<p>Values. It's a word you hear a lot. When we elect government officials we ask "what are their values?" Your grandma probably has certain values that she hopes you'll keep in your family. And most importantly, did you assign all the right values to your variables?! Okay, just kidding on that last one! But seriously, what do you value most when you are happiest? Personally, I value <span class="italic">ambition</span>.</p>

<p>I thought about times when I've been the happiest and most satisfied. Contrary to that, I thought about times when I've been the least satisfied with my life. And I could quickly narrow down the difference in regards to ambition. Right now I can say that I am very happy. I've chosen to change my career and I love what I'm doing now. A lot of that has to do with me feeling ambitious. I'm driven to code every single day and learn as much as I can every single day. And it's fun! I seriously wake up every morning and get excited to open my laptop and start coding. This ambition has given me a whole new perspective on life and has even improved other aspects. However, before I made the change, I wasn't nearly as satisfied. I woke up and went to work because I felt that I <span class="italic">had</span> to. I'm not saying it was all bad, but I didn't feel ambitious like I do now.</p>

<p>Last week I talked about <a href="http://rjmccluskey.github.io/blog/c6-stereotype-threat.html">stereotype threat</a> and how it can get in the way of achieving at your highest level. To recap, it's the impostor in your head telling you that you aren't good enough for this and that. I think that holding ambition as an important value can help fight against stereotype threat. If you are ambitious, you might take on a lot and you might fail at times, but you will also see yourself succeed in ways others (or even yourself) do not think is possible and that success will prove the impostor wrong. Having a track record of these successes born out of your ambition can be a great thing to fall back on when times get tough.</p>
