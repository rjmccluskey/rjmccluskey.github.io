You'll notice a pretty big gap in time between this post and the last post. Well, that's because I was working my ass off at Dev Bootcamp! OK, I probably could've still blogged but the reality is that it's hard for me to consistently write. But now that I've graduated from DBC and I'm looking for jobs I thought, what better time to start again?! There's so much I could talk about but I want to begin with this: _I am a programmer!_
<!-- more -->
Am I programmer because I graduated from a coding school and magically became one that very day? ... No. That's not what I am trying to say and I probably could've called myself one much before that. But I'm writing this now because being away from DBC and on my own has given me time to reflect. It has also given me time to continue to code and continue to learn. Being surrounded by tons of like minded people with the same general goal at DBC makes it pretty easy to stay motivated. But what happens when we leave? Any accountability has to come from myself, and to be honest I think that I've done pretty well. I still want to code, I still want to improve, and I sure as hell still want to do this professionally. I began to apply to jobs, I reinvented my website, and I am jumping on an open source project (more to come on this!). Being away from DBC while still finding the same motivation to code is why I'm a programmer.

So I guess this is me grabbing my identity and shouting it out to the world! I'm so excited for the future and what it holds.
