Hi, my name is Rich and I live in San Luis Obispo, California. I recently graduated from [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/) San Francisco, an intensive course in web development. It was an incredible experience and I worked harder than I ever have, while learning more than I could've dreamed possible!

Now I'm working on my next challenge: becoming a professional web developer! I am passionate about programming and I'm excited to make it my career. If you're interested in my qualifications, check out my [projects](/projects), [résumé](/resume.pdf), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmccluskey). Thanks for visiting!
